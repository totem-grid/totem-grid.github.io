A static blog theme based on [Astro](https://astro.build), designed for clarity and focus.

The layout is intentionally minimal, letting your content take center stage without distraction. Built with flexibility in mind, the theme offers some freedom to customize while preserving its clean aesthetic.

Effortlessly share your thoughts in _a calm & dustless space._
