          Totem Grid (“Company,” “We,” or “Us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and
          share information in connection with our mobile application, Totem Grid (the “App”), available on iOS, watchOS, and
          Android.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <section aria-labelledby="info-collect-heading">
          <h2 id="info-collect-heading">1. Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3>1.1 Location Data (Core Feature)</h3>
          <p>
            The primary function of the App is navigation and social location sharing. We collect:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Precise Real-Time Location:</strong> GPS, Wi‑Fi, and cellular triangulation data to determine your geographical position.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Background Location:</strong> If you opt-in, we collect location data even when the App is closed or not in use to enable
              friend notifications and “always-on” finding features.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.2 Device and Sensor Data</h3>
          <p>
            To provide high-precision “turn-by-turn” navigation and “directional finding” (pointing you toward a friend), we
            access data from your device’s internal sensors, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Radios:</strong> Bluetooth, Ultra‑Wideband (UWB), and Wi‑Fi signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Motion Sensors:</strong> Accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass data.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Battery Status:</strong> To optimize how frequently we update your location based on your remaining power.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.3 User-Provided Information</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Account Data:</strong> A changeable handle to identify yourself on the network to others.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="mesh-heading">
          <h2 id="mesh-heading">2. The Community Signal Network (Mesh Technology)</h2>
          <p>
            A unique feature of the App is its ability to locate users and friends using a distributed device network.
          </p>

          <h3>2.1 Encrypted Data Relay</h3>
          <p>
            By using the App, your device acts as a node in a secure network. Your device may:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sense encrypted signals from other users’ devices nearby.</li>
            <li>Relay encrypted location packets through your device to our servers.</li>
            <li>
              Have its own location reported securely by other users’ devices if you have no cellular signal.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">
            <strong>Important:</strong> All relayed data is End-to-End Encrypted. Your device acts only as a “blind relay.” You cannot see
            the locations of others whose data passes through your phone, nor can they see yours.
          </p>

          <h3>2.2 Precise Ranging</h3>
          <p>
            We utilize your device’s radios to measure the “Time of Flight” and signal strength (RSSI) between your phone and
            your friends’ phones. This data is processed to generate:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Precise distance measurements (ranging).</li>
            <li>Directional arrows to guide you to your friend in crowded spaces.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="use-heading">
          <h2 id="use-heading">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide Navigation:</strong> Calculate routes, traffic, and travel times.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facilitate Friend Finding:</strong> Display your location to friends you have explicitly authorized.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improve Accuracy:</strong> We aggregate anonymous sensor data to refine our positioning algorithms and radio signal models.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety &amp; Security:</strong> Detect unusual account activity or potential misuse (e.g., stalking behavior).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="security-heading">
          <h2 id="security-heading">8. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We implement industry-standard encryption (TLS/SSL) for data in transit and AES encryption for data at rest. However,
            no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect

          <h2 id="addendum-heading">Privacy Policy Addendum: Location Technologies &amp; Data Transmission</h2>

          <h3>1. Encrypted Relay and Network Participation</h3>
          <p>
            To function effectively, the Application utilizes a secure, encrypted network architecture. You acknowledge and agree
            that your device may participate in this network by anonymously sharing encrypted location and identifier data through,
            or receiving such data from, other users’ devices nearby. This process allows the Application to maintain location
            awareness even in environments where direct cellular or GPS connection may be limited.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Encryption:</strong> All data relayed through other devices is end-to-end encrypted. The intermediate devices (other users’
              phones) cannot view or decrypt your personal location data; they act solely as blind relays to transmit the data to our
              servers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Server Mediation</h3>
          <p>
            While peer-to-peer technologies are used for proximity detection, your encrypted location data is transmitted to and
            processed by our central servers. We use these servers to authenticate your account and route your location updates
            specifically to the friends or family members you have explicitly authorized to view your location.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Utilization of Device Radios and Sensors</h3>
          <p>
            The Application actively utilizes your device’s internal radios and sensors—including but not limited to Bluetooth,
            Wi‑Fi, GPS, and Ultra‑Wideband (UWB) chips—to sense signals from the environment and other nearby devices.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Purpose of Sensing:</strong> This signal data is processed to calculate distance and spatial orientation. This enables
              features such as “Precision Finding,” which offers you and your friends more accurate ranging and directional arrows to
              locate one another in real-time (e.g., finding a friend in a crowded venue).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Aggregated signal data may be used to calibrate and improve the overall accuracy and
              responsiveness of the Application’s navigation and finding services.
